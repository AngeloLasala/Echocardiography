Guideline to use in a clever way this repository on LEONARDO cluster.
The main idea is to use this as a proper repository and use each code as a module that take as 
input the proper information as flags.

The first informatio is the tree structure of the project. ALL the data and the code are in the 
provided $WORK directory of cineca. 
$ cd $WORK

the currect tree strucuture is:

Angelo
├── Echocardiography  ## repository with ALL the codes about the echocardiography
├── echo_data         ## folder with ALL the data about the echocardiography
├── venv              ## folder with ALL the virtual envs

1. ACTIVATE THE VENV
To activate the eco env, in 'Angelo':
$ source venv/eco/bin/activate
NOTE: keep in mind that when you create a new file with new required packages, you have to reinstall all the repository
and update the venv. to do so, use the file setup.py and the requirements.txt

2. RUN A PYTHON CODE
The easy way to run a python code in this tree is to leverege the structure of the repository and
run ANY KIND of python code as a module from the 'Echocardiography' directory. So, in the 'Echocardiography' run:
$ python -m path.of.the.code --flag
$ python -m echocardiography.diffusion.tools.sample_cond_ldm --data eco_image_cond (this is a simple example)
